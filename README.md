# 💻 Daily Coding Questions

Welcome to the **Daily Coding Questions** repository!  
This project is dedicated to practicing and tracking daily problem-solving efforts across various platforms (starting with HackerRank). The goal is to build consistent problem-solving habits while organizing solutions in a clean, date-wise structure.

## 📅 Folder Structure

Each day's work is stored in a separate folder named using the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.  
Each folder contains a `.pages` document that includes all questions and solutions attempted on that specific day.

Daily-Coding-Questions/
├── 2025-06-30/
│ └── solution.pages
├── 2025-07-01/
│ └── solution.pages
├── 2025-07-02/
│ └── solution.pages
...

## ✍️ How This Works

1. I solve coding problems daily (currently using [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)).
2. I write all code, explanations, and notes inside `Coding Questions Daily.pages`.
3. Each day’s updated file is copied into a date-wise folder and pushed to this repository.
4. This allows version tracking, organization, and long-term progress review.
